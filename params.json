When the window is closed, \r\n\tthe session fields are lost, even if the site remains open in another window.\r\n+ localStorage sets fields on the domain. Even when you close the browser, \r\n\treopen it, and go back to the site, it remembers all fields in localStorage.\r\n\r\nSo, I need a persistence data storage.\r\n\r\n- The size of localStorage is limited by each browser, \r\n\tif you want to control your own space let see Manifest!\r\n--=========================================================================--","tagline":"javascript storage"}
